Changes in version 1.1.5 (2021-XX-XX)
+ Additional query filters have been added to getIntervalStateVectors()
+ Fixed a bug leading to wrong formatting of category description for aircraft metadata
+ Fixed a bug leading to unintended behavior of functions with maxQueryAttempts parameter, where 1 attempt less than specified was performed
+ Fixed a bug in plotRoutes leading to crashes in rare cases when the values of latitude, but not those of longitude, for an openSkiesStateVectorSet are NA
+ OpenSky Network coverage can now be retrieved with getOSNCoverage()
+ Added method remove_redundants to objects of class openSkiesStateVectorSet, to remove state vectors that did not contain any update of positional or other type of information
+ getVectorSetFeatures and getVectorSetListFeatures now have a fields argument, that can be used to specify which fields should be used to extract features for clustering
+ Fixed another possible type of failure of the state vectors endpoint of the live API

Changes in version 1.1.4 (2021-08-09)
+ Fixed the behaviour of functions accessing Internet resources to default to 60 seconds timeout
+ It is now possible to specify a timeout and a maximum number of query attempts for functions accessing the OpenSky Network live API

Changes in version 1.1.3 (2021-08-03)
+ Fixed a bug leading to wrong formatting of Impala shell queries with more than 1024 hits
+ Fixed a bug causing split_into_flights method for openSkiesStateVectorSet objects to crash when flights with a single state vector were detected
+ Fixed minor formatting errors of print methods for R6 classes
+ More unit tests added

Changes in version 1.1.2 (2021-07-30)
+ State vectors for a full time interval can now be retrieved through the Impala shell
+ Fixed bug resulting in errors when no results where returned by queries to the Impala shell 

Changes in version 1.1.0 (2021-03-05)
